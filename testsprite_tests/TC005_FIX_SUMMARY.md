# Test 5 (TC005) Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Test 5 (Search Products by Category and Filter) was failing with the following problems:

1. **Incomplete Test Implementation**: The test file had a forced failure (`assert False`) and was not actually testing any functionality
2. **Missing Test Logic**: No actual product search or filtering tests were implemented
3. **Incorrect Element Selectors**: The test was looking for elements that didn't exist in the actual application

## Root Cause Analysis
The test was created as a placeholder and never properly implemented. It contained:
- A forced assertion failure
- No actual test steps for search and filtering
- Generic element selectors that didn't match the application structure

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Complete Test Implementation
- Replaced the forced failure with actual test logic
- Implemented proper test steps for product search and filtering
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Correct Element Selectors
- **Search Input**: Updated to target `input[type="text"][placeholder*="Search"]` which matches the actual SidebarFilters component
- **Product Cards**: Changed to `a[href*="/product/"]` which matches the ProductCard component structure
- **Category Buttons**: Updated to use `button:has-text()` selectors for specific category names
- **Tag Buttons**: Added proper selectors for tag filtering (New, Bestseller, Limited, Bundle)
- **Price Range**: Added test for the price range slider

### 3. Test Flow Implementation
The test now properly:
1. Navigates to the shop page (`/shop`)
2. Waits for products to load
3. Tests search functionality by entering "hoodie" in the search input
4. Tests category filtering by clicking on "Apparel" category
5. Tests tag filtering by clicking on "New" tag
6. Tests price range filtering by adjusting the slider to £100
7. Verifies that filtered results are displayed
8. Tests product interaction by clicking on a product card

### 4. Environment Setup
- Confirmed local Supabase instance is running on port 54321
- Verified database has product data (10 products available)
- Confirmed development server is running on port 5173
- Database was reset to ensure clean test environment

## Test Results
✅ **Test Status**: PASSED
- Successfully found and tested search input
- Successfully applied category filters (Apparel)
- Successfully applied tag filters (New)
- Successfully adjusted price range filters
- Verified filtered results (1 product found after filtering)
- All search and filtering functionality working correctly

## Technical Details

### Application Structure
- **ShopPage**: Main component handling product display and filtering
- **SidebarFilters**: Component with search input, category buttons, tag buttons, and price range slider
- **ProductCard**: Individual product display component
- **API**: `getProducts()` function successfully fetches products from Supabase

### Database State
- Products table contains 10 products with various categories (apparel, gear, bundles)
- Categories: All Products(10), Apparel(3), Gear(3), Bundles(3)
- Tags: New, Bestseller, Limited Edition, Bundle Deals
- Price range: £0-£200 (0-20000 pence)

### Local Environment
- Supabase running on: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- Development server on: http://localhost:5173
- Database: PostgreSQL on port 54322
- All services running and accessible

## Lessons Learned
1. **Test Completeness**: Tests should be fully implemented, not just placeholders
2. **Element Selection**: Use specific, accurate selectors that match the actual component structure
3. **Environment Verification**: Always verify that required services are running before testing
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all aspects of the functionality (search, categories, tags, price, navigation)

## Next Steps
Test 5 is now fully functional and can be used as a reference for implementing other tests. The same approach should be applied to fix the remaining failing tests (TC006-TC018) by:
1. Implementing proper test logic
2. Using correct element selectors
3. Verifying environment setup
4. Testing actual functionality rather than placeholder code
