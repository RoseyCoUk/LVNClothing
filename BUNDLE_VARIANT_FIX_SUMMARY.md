# Bundle Variant Selection Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Customers ordering bundles were receiving incorrect product variants. When selecting Navy Large Hoodie, Navy Large T-shirt, and Navy Cap through the Activist bundle, Printful was receiving Black Large Hoodie, Black Medium T-shirt, and Black Cap instead.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Webhook Handler (`supabase/functions/stripe-webhook2/index.ts`)

**Key Change**: Modified lines 461-507 to use actual variant IDs from frontend instead of hardcoded defaults.

```typescript
// BEFORE: Always used hardcoded variants
const BUNDLE_VARIANT_IDS = {
  'tshirt': 4938821288,  // Always Black M
  'hoodie': 4938800535,  // Always Black L
  'cap': 4938937571,     // Always Black
};

// AFTER: Uses customer selections
if (item.printful_variant_id) {
  console.log(`Using customer-selected variant ID: ${item.printful_variant_id}`);
  return { ...item, printful_variant_id: item.printful_variant_id };
}
```

**Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track variant resolution:
- Shows color/size/variant ID for each item
- Logs order summary before fulfillment
- Helps monitor that correct variants are being used

### 2. Frontend - Bundle Pages

#### ActivistBundlePage.tsx
- **Line 10**: Fixed import from `useHoodieVariants` to `findHoodieVariant`
- **Lines 756-769**: Added design parameter (DARK/LIGHT) to hoodie variant lookups
- **Lines 886-891**: Fixed SKU generation with correct variant lookup

#### ChampionBundlePage.tsx  
- **Line 10**: Fixed import to use `findHoodieVariant` directly
- **Lines 547-560**: Added design parameter to hoodie variant lookups

### 3. Testing & Documentation

Created test script (`scripts/test-bundle-variant-mapping.ts`) that verifies:
- ✅ Navy Large Hoodie resolves to catalogVariantId 5541
- ✅ Navy Cap resolves to catalogVariantId 7857
- ✅ Fallback variants work correctly

## 📊 Data Flow (Fixed)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User selects Navy/Large] -->|Frontend| B[findHoodieVariant]
    B -->|Returns| C[catalogVariantId: 5541]
    C -->|Cart| D[printful_variant_id: 5541]
    D -->|Payment| E[Metadata with variant]
    E -->|Webhook| F[Uses actual variant ID]
    F -->|Printful| G[Correct Navy Large Hoodie]
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy Webhook Changes**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-webhook-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Frontend Changes**: Already active (client-side code)

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Monitor webhook logs
   supabase functions logs stripe-webhook2 --tail
   
   # Look for these log messages:
   # "Using customer-selected variant ID: 5541"
   # "Order Summary: ... Navy, Size: L"
   ```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Place test order with Activist bundle
- [ ] Select Navy Large Hoodie, Navy Large T-shirt, Navy Cap
- [ ] Verify webhook logs show correct variant IDs
- [ ] Check Printful order has correct variants
- [ ] Confirm customer receives correct products

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

1. **Immediate**: Correct variant IDs in webhook logs
2. **Short-term**: Printful orders match customer selections
3. **Long-term**: Zero variant mismatch complaints

## 🔍 Monitoring

Monitor these metrics post-deployment:
- Webhook success rate (should remain unchanged)
- "Using customer-selected variant ID" log frequency
- Customer complaints about wrong variants (should drop to zero)
- Printful order accuracy

## 🛡️ Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert webhook to previous version
2. Frontend changes can be reverted via git
3. Contact Printful support for any in-flight orders

## 📝 Notes

- Hardcoded defaults remain as fallback for edge cases
- Non-customizable items (mug, water bottle, etc.) still use fixed variants
- Discount items are properly excluded from Printful fulfillment

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
- Customer orders Navy/Large → Printful receives Navy/Large
- All bundle types (Starter, Champion, Activist) work correctly
- No regression in individual product orders
- Zero variant mismatch reports
